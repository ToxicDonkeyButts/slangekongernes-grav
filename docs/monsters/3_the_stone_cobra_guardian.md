The Stone Cobra Guardian cannot fit up the **[18: Stairs](/)**.

**Attacks:** Each round, the Stone Cobra Guardian can perform one of three attack patterns:

---

_Shield Draw._ The Guardian calls to a shield attached to
the wall of the arena. The shield deals d6 damage (Save to
Dodge negates) to any creatures between it and the
Guardian. The Guardian holds the shield in its empty
hand, granting it +1 Defense. The shield can be sundered
as normal (reducing incoming damage by 1d12 and
destroying the shield).

---

_Leap and Slam._ The Guardian leaps into the air and slams
down 5'–20' away from its starting position. It will not
land directly on creatures, but any adjacent creatures take
1d4 damage. Save negates. Creatures that take damage
are knocked prone.

---

_Twin Slash._ The Guardian swipes at two targets with its
sword. The targets must be on the same facing (front, left
side, right side, or rear) and must be adjacent to the
Guardian. The Guardian rolls a normal attack against both
targets separately, dealing 1d8+Strength bonus damage
on a hit.

---

The room is designed for the players to flank the Guardian,
flee, push it into the chasm, or flee past it and hope it
doesn’t follow them (it will, but only until it can no longer
see or hear them). The shields on the walls can be used
by PCs as well.
