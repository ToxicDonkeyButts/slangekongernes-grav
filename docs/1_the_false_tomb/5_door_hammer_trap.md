# 5: Door/Hammer Trap

![5-8](5-8.jpg)

A large door, barred with a lengthy piece of stone hung on
two iron pegs set into either side of the doorframe. Requires
at least three PCs to lift (or, if the party is smaller, all PCs).
When the bar is lifted, the iron pegs begin to rise. When the
bar is fully removed a trap is activated. A huge stone hammer
swings down from the ceiling, aiming straight for the backs
of the now-trapped PCs. It nearly fills the corridor, but there
is a small gap on either side. The PCs can:

1. Save to Dodge OR
2. Use another PC as a springboard, giving them +2 to Dodge but giving the shoved PC â€“2.

PCs hit by the hammer automatically die (or take serious
damage, like 2d6+4).

This trap can be identified by examining the door or pegs, by
noticing that the iron pegs slowly rise as the bar is lifted, or by
checking the ceiling. If the bar is quickly replaced, if the pegs
are held down, or if the trap mechanism in the ceiling is
damaged, the trap will not activate.

> **Lessons:** there are deadly traps. The dungeon can be lethal.

After firing, the hammer slowly retracts into the ceiling
unless blocked. It can be reactivated by lifting up the iron
pegs, either by hand or by a rope. Its first activation knocks
open the stone doors leading to **[6: False King's Tomb](./6_false_kings_tomb.md)**.
