# 7: False Temple

![5-8](5-8.jpg)

This room contains a giant statue of a hideous snake-man
god, resembling a cross between a toad, a heap of intestines,
and a melted candle. Water leaking into the tomb has eroded
the floor, revealing a secret passage under the statue to
**LEVEL 2** of the dungeon.

> **Lessons:** there are secret passages. They are associated
> with statues. This might be a false tomb.
>
> Throughout this dungeon, statues will be associated
> with secret passages and treasure.
