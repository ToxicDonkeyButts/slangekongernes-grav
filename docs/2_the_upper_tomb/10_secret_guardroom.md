# 10: Secret Guardroom

![9-10](9-10.jpg)

This room was once a secret guardroom for temple assassins.
Now it is empty and dark. The furniture has rotted to fragments.
On the wall are two hooked polearms that are still usable,
along with a silver icon of a scowling snake-man king worth 5gp.

> **Lessons:** secret rooms sometimes contain more *treasure*.
